# ruby-merge-sort-
This repository contains a Ruby implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
The merge_sort method recursively divides an array into smaller halves until the base case is reached (an array with one or zero elements). The merge method efficiently merges the sorted halves back together. Included is an example usage with an array of integers. Explore and understand the inner workings of the Merge Sort algorithm with this clear and concise Ruby implementation.
